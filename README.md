# DengueForecasting
Study 1: Evaluating the Performance of Infectious Disease Predictive Models: A comparison of Machine Learning and Regression Based Models

Goal: The goal of this study is to evaluate three primary questions
  1) How well do machine learning models forecast dengue occurrence, relative to regression-based models?
  2) How is model accuracy impacted by the availability – or lack of – current dengue surveillance data?
  3) Among data used in our models, what were the strongest predictors of dengue occurrence?

Code for this study are provided in R. Links to publically available data sources will be added
